## Project Overview 
This project demonstrates the use of automated testing, static analysis,
and continuous integration using GitHub Actions via the command line.
The Assignment5_SE333 repo contains two main modules, the Barnes&Noble project
which focuses on specification-based / structural-based unit testing, and the 
Amazon project which focuses on integration and unit testing using database
resets + mocking. 
All tests, coverage, and analysis are automatically executed through GitHub action
workflow names SE333_CI.yml
